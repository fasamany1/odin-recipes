**Project: Recipes**

It’s time to put all of the HTML knowledge I've been acquired so far
into practice.

In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few
recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time I'll be done.

By the end of the project I was able to:

   1. Write basic boilerplate for an HTML document.

   2. Open HTML documents in a browser.

   3. Create paragraphs and headings.

   4. Ctreate both ordered and unordered lists.

   5. Create links to other pages on your own website.

   6. Display images on webpage using HTML.
